# Deep Work

## Introduction
**Deep Work:** Professional acivities performed i a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

The reason for knowledge workers losing their familiarity with dep work is well established: **network tools**. A 2012 McKinsey study found that about 60% of a work week is engaged in electronic communication, with 30% spend on email. These fragmented attention cannot accomodate deep work.

**Shallow Work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, oftern perfomerd while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
Network tools negatively impact our ability for deep work.
Deep work is a skill that has great value for two reasons:
- Learning: to remai valuable in our economy, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things.
- Generate the best content: a task that requires depth.

**The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becomig icreasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequece, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

Two goals of the book:
- convince you the deep work hypothesis is true.
- teach your brain and tranform your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life.
The book describes an attempt to formalize and explain the attraction of depth over shallowness, and the strategies one can use.

## Idea
### Deep Work Is Valuable
In the future economy, repetetive skil become automated or easily outsourced, on the other hand others will thrive and become more valuable.
- **High Skilled Workers** - those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
- **The Superstars - Once** the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.
- **The Owners** - As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing.

In this new economy, three groups will have particular advatage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy
Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy
1. The ability to uickly master hard things.
To join the group of group of those who can work well with these machines, requires that we hone the ability to master hard things. In a changing economy, it is necessary to do this quickly, again and again. 

2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
If you don't produce, you won't thrive - no matter how skilled or talented you are.

The two core abilities described depend on your ability to perform deep work. in a form of deliberate practice. In it's core deliberatie practice is identified as:
1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to master.
2. You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attraction exactly where it's most productive.

Science shows that with a high focus, we isolate the relevant neural circuits to trigger **myelination**.

### Deep Work helps you produce at an elite level
One approach to increase once productivity can be the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uniterrupted stretches. The simple law of productivity:

**High-QUality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**

The law of productivity aligns with the **concept of attention residue**.

It is important to note that working in a semidistraction (e.g. watching inbox) is potentially devastating to your performance. Every quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse you may pick up tasks you can not resolve right away. This secondary task and its attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.

As a result, **the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work**. Without getting comfortable with deep work, it;ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally.

It is important, that if your're a high-level executive at a major company, you probably don't need the advice in the pages that follow. On he other hand we can't extrapolate the approach of these executives to other jobs. We need to remember throughout the book, **there are certain corners of our economy where depth is not valued.** Don't make a mistake to put yourself into the "to important" pile it is most likely not true.

## Deep Work Is Rare
Three new trends emerged in the recent years, open offices, instant messaging, and content producers for social media. These three business trends highlight a paradox. They are the opposite of the ideas presented in the earlier chapter. 

### The Metric Black Hole
Generally speaking as knowledge work makes more complex demands of he labor force, it becomes harder to measue the value of an idividual's efforts. It can't be expected to easily detect the botoom-line impact of depth-destroying behaviors.

### The principle of Least Resistance
**The Principle of Least Resistance:** In a business setting, without clear feedback on th eimpact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend torward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

If you coudn't count on a quick response time you'd instaed have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewehere while waiting for what you requested.
It creates an environment where it beomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox - responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive.

The Priciple of Least Resistance, protected from crutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
**Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity:** n the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, manu knowledge workers turn back torwards an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

### The Cult of the Internet
We've made the internet synonymous with the revolutionary future of business and goverment. Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in such a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. Eve worse, to support deep work ofternrequires the rejectio of much of what is new and high-tech.

### Bad for Business. Good for You.
Assuming the trends outlined continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Haing established that there's nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and nothing fudamentally necessary about the distracting behavior that displace it.
