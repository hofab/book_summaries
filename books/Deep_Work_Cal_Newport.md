# Deep Work

## Introduction
**Deep Work:** Professional acivities performed i a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

The reason for knowledge workers losing their familiarity with dep work is well established: **network tools**. A 2012 McKinsey study found that about 60% of a work week is engaged in electronic communication, with 30% spend on email. These fragmented attention cannot accomodate deep work.

**Shallow Work:** Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, oftern perfomerd while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
Network tools negatively impact our ability for deep work.
Deep work is a skill that has great value for two reasons:
- Learning: to remai valuable in our economy, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things.
- Generate the best content: a task that requires depth.

**The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becomig icreasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequece, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

Two goals of the book:
- convince you the deep work hypothesis is true.
- teach your brain and tranform your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life.
The book describes an attempt to formalize and explain the attraction of depth over shallowness, and the strategies one can use.

## Idea
### Deep Work Is Valuable
In the future economy, repetetive skil become automated or easily outsourced, on the other hand others will thrive and become more valuable.
- **High Skilled Workers** - those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.
- **The Superstars - Once** the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.
- **The Owners** - As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing.

In this new economy, three groups will have particular advatage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy
Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy
1. The ability to uickly master hard things.
To join the group of group of those who can work well with these machines, requires that we hone the ability to master hard things. In a changing economy, it is necessary to do this quickly, again and again. 

2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
If you don't produce, you won't thrive - no matter how skilled or talented you are.

The two core abilities described depend on your ability to perform deep work. in a form of deliberate practice. In it's core deliberatie practice is identified as:
1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to master.
2. You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attraction exactly where it's most productive.

Science shows that with a high focus, we isolate the relevant neural circuits to trigger **myelination**.

### Deep Work helps you produce at an elite level
One approach to increase once productivity can be the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uniterrupted stretches. The simple law of productivity:

**High-QUality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**

The law of productivity aligns with the **concept of attention residue**.

It is important to note that working in a semidistraction (e.g. watching inbox) is potentially devastating to your performance. Every quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse you may pick up tasks you can not resolve right away. This secondary task and its attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.

As a result, **the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work**. Without getting comfortable with deep work, it;ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally.

It is important, that if your're a high-level executive at a major company, you probably don't need the advice in the pages that follow. On he other hand we can't extrapolate the approach of these executives to other jobs. We need to remember throughout the book, **there are certain corners of our economy where depth is not valued.** Don't make a mistake to put yourself into the "to important" pile it is most likely not true.

## Deep Work Is Rare
Three new trends emerged in the recent years, open offices, instant messaging, and content producers for social media. These three business trends highlight a paradox. They are the opposite of the ideas presented in the earlier chapter. 

### The Metric Black Hole
Generally speaking as knowledge work makes more complex demands of he labor force, it becomes harder to measue the value of an idividual's efforts. It can't be expected to easily detect the botoom-line impact of depth-destroying behaviors.

### The principle of Least Resistance
**The Principle of Least Resistance:** In a business setting, without clear feedback on th eimpact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend torward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

If you coudn't count on a quick response time you'd instaed have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewehere while waiting for what you requested.
It creates an environment where it beomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox - responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive.

The Priciple of Least Resistance, protected from crutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
**Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity:** n the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, manu knowledge workers turn back torwards an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

### The Cult of the Internet
We've made the internet synonymous with the revolutionary future of business and goverment. Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in such a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. Eve worse, to support deep work ofternrequires the rejectio of much of what is new and high-tech.

### Bad for Business. Good for You.
Assuming the trends outlined continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Haing established that there's nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and nothing fudamentally necessary about the distracting behavior that displace it.

## Deep Work Is Meaningful
Craftsman tackle professional cheallenges that are simple to define but difficult to execute. Knowledge work exchanges this clarity for ambiguity.

### A Neurological Argument for Depth
Like fingers poiting to the moon. other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioral economics to family coundeling, similarly suggest that the skillful managment of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving vitually every aspect of your expirience.

"Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on"

In work (and especialy kowledge work), to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you'll associate with your working life.

### A Psychological Argument for Depth
Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oeself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.

To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.

### A Philosophical Argument for Depth
You don't need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.
Deep work is key to extracting meanig from your profession.

## The Rules
### Rule #1 Work Deeply
In an ideal world-one in which the true value of dee work is accepted and celebrated-we'd all have access to a work environment (and culture) designed to help us extract as much value as possible from our brains.
Peope fight desires all day long. "Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception" (Book: Willpower)
The thruth about willpower is, you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Therefore, the idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life desgned to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. With this in mind, he six strategies that follow can be understood as an arsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited wilpower in mint to maximize the amount of deep work you consistently accomplish in your schedule.

#### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy
You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your professional life. You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific cicumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify.

##### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of th emonastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional sucess comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well.

The clarity with which the moastic philosophy adherents identify their value to the world, touches a raw nerve for those whose contribution to the iformation economy is more complex.

##### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicatig some clearly defined stretches to deep pusuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically - seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales, weekly, month, season, or even seasons. A minimum of a day needs to be dedicated to deep work for this philosophy. This bimodal philosophy is best for people who can't effort to detach from all commitments. Probably the biggest obstacle of this implementation is the need of a flexibility, that many fear not to have. But this fear is unsubstential, if these periods of absence are well defined and well advetised, and outside these stretches, your are easily found.

#### he Rythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessios is to transform them into a simple regular habit. 

#### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

This approach fits deep work wherever you can in your schedule. This approach is not for the deep work novice. The ability to rapidly switch your mind from shallow to dep mode doesn't come naturally. Without practice, such switches can seriously dplete your finite willpower reserves. This habit also requires a sense of confidence in your abilities - a conviction that what you're doing is important and will suceed. This confidence goes a long way in motivating hard efforts.

### Ritualize

"Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants" David Brooks
To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentioned previously. Rituals minimize the friction in the transition into depth, and stay in the state longer. 

*There's no one correct deep work ritual - the right fit depends on both the person and the type of project pursued. But an effective ritual must adress the following questions.
- *Where you'll work and for how long.*
- *How you'll work once you start to work.*
- *How you'll support your work.*

This questions help to draft your deep work ritual. But finding a ritual that sticks might require experimentation and work.

### Make Grand Gestures

The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or moey, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, the perceived importance of the task is increased. Such an importance boost reduces your mind's instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.
Increasing your mental priority helps unlock the needed mental resources.

### Dont Work Alone

For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were orking alone. The presence of another party waiting for your next insight ca short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.
For deep work use collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level.

### Execute Like a Business
In business we often know what to do but not how to do it, this is crucial and is overlooked usually overlooked in the professional world. Whit this in mind, the following sections discribe how to adapt the 4DX framework for developing a deep work habit.

#### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important

"If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions zou find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else." David Brooks - The Art of Focus

#### Discipline #2: Act o the Lead Measures

Once the widly important goals are identified, its success needs to be measured. There are two types of metrics: *lead* and *lag* measures. Lag measures describe the things we ultimately trying to improve. Unfortunately, this measures come to late to influence your behavior.
Lead measures, on the other hand, measure the new behavior that will drive success on the lag measures. In the case of deep work, the lead measure is easily identified as, **time spent in a state of deep work dedicated torward your widly important goal.**

#### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

"People play different when they're keeping score" David Brooks - The Art of Focus. Therefore, in the preceding discipline, it was argued that for an individual focused on deep work, hours spent working deeply should be the lead measure. It follows, therefore, that the individual's scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual's current deep work hour count. This serves two purposes. First, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accuulated deep work hours and tangible results. Second, it helped calibrate my experience for how many hours of deep work were needed per result.

#### Discipline #4: Create a Cadece of Accountability

The 4DX authors elaborate that the final step to help maintain a focus on lead measures is to put in place "a rythm of regular and freuent meetings of any team that owns a widly important goal." Durin these meetings, the team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting, and describe what happened with the commitments the made at the last meeting.

The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing.

### Be Lazy
